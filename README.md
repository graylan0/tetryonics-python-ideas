# tetryonics-python-ideas
This script is a simple simulation of some concepts from Tetryonics, a speculative theory of quantum mechanics. Here's a breakdown of the script:

1. **PlanckQuantum class:** This class represents a Planck quantum, the fundamental unit of quantum mechanics in Tetryonics. Each Planck quantum has an orientation, which is a numerical value.

2. **Particle class:** This class represents a particle, which is composed of multiple Planck quanta. The `total_orientation` method calculates the sum of the orientations of all the quanta in the particle. The `change_orientation` method changes the orientation of all the quanta in the particle to a new value. The `visualize` method creates a histogram of the orientations of the quanta in the particle.

3. **ComplexParticle class:** This class represents a complex particle, which is composed of multiple particles. The methods of this class are similar to those of the `Particle` class, but operate on the constituent particles of the complex particle instead of individual quanta.

4. **create_particle and create_complex_particle functions:** These functions take a list of quanta or particles, respectively, and return a new `Particle` or `ComplexParticle` object.

5. **interact function:** This is a placeholder for a function that would simulate an interaction between two particles. The result of the interaction could be a new particle or complex particle.

The "Example usage" section of the script demonstrates how to create Planck quanta and particles, change the orientation of a particle, visualize a particle, create a complex particle, and simulate an interaction between two particles.

Please note that this script is a very simplified representation and does not fully implement the Tetryonics theory. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Tetryonics is not widely accepted in the scientific community, and its predictions have not been experimentally confirmed.
